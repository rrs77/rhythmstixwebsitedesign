Originally built for Performing Arts, its flexible framework adapts to any curriculum area — from Music and Drama to English, Science, and beyond. Through a user-friendly interface you can quickly and easily grade work, evaluate student progress and generate detailed reports. Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, Assessify streamlines the assessment process for teachers and enhances student learning.",

Build your own bank of assessments for each year group you teach and tailor the rubrics to match the needs of your children — keeping all previous assessments in one place so you can review progress easily.",
